Less-flow
=========

Watcher, compiler and prefixer

Less-flow is a tool built for simpler less-development.



## Getting started
* Install with npm<br>
  `npm install -g less-flow`
* Run it in current directory from terminal:<br>
  `less-flow`<br>
  Or specify directories:<br>
  `less-flow ./less/ ../other_module/less/`


## Usage
Files will be outputed in the same directory as the compiled less-file and with the same name except for extension.

## Features
Whenever a less-file is saved in watched directories the file-source gets compiled to css and prefixed with vendor-prefixes.
